### Production-Standard Directory Structure

production-standard directory structure for your `my-web-project`:

```

### Next Steps

1. **Move Your Files**: Based on this structure, start moving your files into the appropriate directories.
   
2. **Update Paths in Your Project**: After reorganizing, update the file paths in your scripts, Dockerfiles, and any configuration files to reflect the new structure.

3. **Update Your CI/CD Pipeline**: Make sure that the paths in your CI/CD pipeline (`ci-cd.yml`) reflect this new structure. This includes updating any paths used for copying files, executing scripts, or building Docker images.

4. **Test the Setup Locally**: Before deploying to production, test the new structure locally to ensure that all files are correctly referenced and that the application runs without errors.

5. **Deploy to Production**: Once everything is tested and working locally, you can use your CI/CD pipeline to deploy the updated project structure to your server.

### Additional Considerations for Production

- **Version Control**: Ensure all directories are properly set up in your version control system (like Git) and that the repository reflects the new structure.
- **Environment Management**: If you use different environments (development, staging, production), maintain separate environment files (`.env`) and configurations to handle different settings and credentials.
- **Security Best Practices**: Ensure sensitive information like environment variables, database credentials, and API keys are securely managed, preferably using environment variables or secret management services.
- **Documentation**: Keep your `README.md` and other documentation up to date to reflect the new structure. This is important for onboarding new developers and maintaining the project.

Following this structured approach will set you up for success as your project grows and evolves. If you need any further assistance with this transition or have any questions about best practices, feel free to ask!
